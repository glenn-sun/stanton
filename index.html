				<div>
					On November 12, 1815, Elizabeth Cady Stanton was born in Johnstown, New York.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="b05">
				<div>
					She was the eighth of eleven children, of which five died early, leaving just her, a brother, and four sisters.
				</div>
				<div>
					Her father was a lawyer and congressman who introduced Elizabeth to law.
				</div>
				<div>
					It was through perusing her father's library that she realized the great inequalities which faced women, virtually without property or employment after marriage.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="b06">
				<div>
					When Elizabeth was eleven, her brother died, just having graduated from college.
				</div>
				<div>
					As she described it in her memoir, he was the pride of her father's heart. 
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="b07">
				<div>
					While Elizabeth was also undergoing formal education, a rarity for girls, her father told her,
				</div>
				<div>
					"Oh, my daughter, I wish you were a boy!"
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="b08">
				<div>
					After graduating from the Troy Female Seminary in 1832 and marrying Henry Stanton in 1840, Elizabeth finally began her work in women's rights.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="b09">
				<div>
					And thus begins the long story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. 
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="section-start off" id="c00">
				<div>
					Part 1: Seeds of Change
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="content-text off" id="c01">
				<div>
					In 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton organized the Seneca Falls Convention with Lucretia Mott.
				</div>
				<div>
					At the convention, she called for women's rights in the Declaration of Sentiments.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="c02">
				<div>
					"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness...
				</div>
				<div>
					The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world...
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="c03">
				<div>
					He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise...
				</div>
				<div>
					He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns...
				</div>
				<div>
					He has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough education, all colleges being closed against her..."
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="c04">
				<div>
					Though most of her proposals were passed unanimously by the people who attended, the right to vote was called to attention by women and men alike.
				</div>
				<div>
					The resolution did pass, but subjected the Seneca Falls Convention to ridicule.
				</div>
			</div>

				<div>
					In 1851, Stanton met Susan B. Anthony, another key figure in the fight for womens' rights, and one who would be a life-long friend of Stanton.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="c06">
				<div>
					Though both started their work together on reducing alcohol consumption in the temperance movement, they moved on to women's suffrage and rights shortly after.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="section-start off" id="d00">
				<div>
					Part 2: Growth of a Movement
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="d01">
				<div>
					Working together with Anthony, Stanton continued fighting for women's rights and suffrage over the next many years.
				</div>
				<div>
					While Anthony often did the organizing, Stanton was a powerful speechwriter.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="d02">
				<div>
					In her speech titled The Destructive Male, she said:
				</div>
				<div>
					"The male element is a destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving war, violence, conquest, acquisition, breeding in the material and moral world alike discord, disorder, disease, and death. See what a record of blood and cruelty the pages of history reveal!"
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="d03">
				<div>
					With Anthony, she formed the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869. 
				</div>
				<div>
					Stanton served as president until the association merged with another women's suffrage group to form the Nation American Woman Suffrace Association.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="d04">
				<div>
					However, Stanton soon began to face disagreement with her collegues.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="d05">
				<div>
					She wrote The Women's Bible in 1895, sparking controversy amongst the religiously conservative NAWSA.
				</div>
				<div>
					But nevertheless, Elizabeth Cady Stanton would keep fighting until the very end.
				</div>
			</div>

				<div>
					Epilogue
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="section-start off" id="e01">
				<div>
					On October 26, 1902, Elizabeth Cady Stanton died in her home of heart failure.
				</div>
				<div>
					It would be another eighteen years of fighting before the 19th amendment would pass, guaranteeing all women the right to vote.
