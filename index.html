					On November 12, 1815, Elizabeth Cady Stanton was born in Johnstown, New York.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="b05">
				<div>
					She was the eighth of eleven children, of which five died early, leaving just her, a brother, and four sisters.
				</div>
				<div>
					Her father was a lawyer and congressman who introduced Elizabeth to law.
				</div>
				<div>
					It was through perusing her father's library that she realized the great inequalities which faced women, virtually without property or employment after marriage.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="b06">
				<div>
					When Elizabeth was eleven, her brother died, just having graduated from college.
				</div>
				<div>
					As she described it in her memoir, he was the pride of her father's heart. 
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="b07">
				<div>
					While Elizabeth was also undergoing formal education, a rarity for girls, her father told her,
				</div>
				<div>
					"Oh, my daughter, I wish you were a boy!"
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="b08">
				<div>
					After graduating from the Troy Female Seminary in 1832 and marrying Henry Stanton in 1840, Elizabeth finally began her work in women's rights.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="content-text off" id="b09">
				<div>
					And thus begins the long story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
